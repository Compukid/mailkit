# mailkit
storing code from https://adamtheautomator.com/powershell-email/ to help send secure e-mail from PowerShell
Since the powershell function send-mailmessage is no longer recommended. There are some alternatives and
this repository is to help me with my projects that may need a secure way to send email.
This is still a work in progress, but just as the author from above website anyone can use this code and or add to this. 
Thank you
